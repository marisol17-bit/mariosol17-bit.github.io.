              <!-- write a paragraph explaining why your person is so great  -->
              <p>Ana Maria Polo is my hero because she is a lawyer and she is my example to follow. She has made me understand that no matter how hard things are you have to keep fighting for your goals in life. She makes me want to achieve my goals in life. When I was about 7 years old my mom would always watch her on Telemundo in the show Caso Cerado. When I saw her during her cases she inspired me to become a lawyer someday. Ever since that moment I wanted to become a lawyer. Dra. Ana Maria Polo has also showed me that we have to say the truth no matter what. She has made me understand that just because someone is diffrent in ways others arn't we still need to treat them like we are one of them. She has just made me want to one day become like her, and help as many families, kids, animals, and much more.
